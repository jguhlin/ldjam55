# Game Idea
- Wizard, looking for artifacts to summon manifestations (elements, spirits, demons, whatever)
- Send out expeditions to find artifacts, explore the procedurally generated map
- Must protect expeditions
- Must protect the wizard's tower
- Periodically do battle (auto battler, simple, summonings usually win or fight against other summon)

# Game Mechanics
- Procedurally generated map
- Send out expeditions
- Protect expeditions
- Protect tower
- Auto battler
- Exploration

# TODO
- Make rng seed and map seed separate so that map can be predictable at least...
- Others things we want predictable can be an addition to the seed and a hash as a shortcut...
