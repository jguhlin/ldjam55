# Game Idea
- Wizard, looking for artifacts to summon manifestations (elements, spirits, demons, whatever)
- Send out expeditions to find artifacts, explore the procedurally generated map
- Must protect expeditions
- Must protect the wizard's tower
- Periodically do battle (auto battler, simple, summonings usually win or fight against other summon)

# Game Mechanics
[x] Procedurally generated map
[ ] Send out expeditions
[ ] Protect expeditions
[ ] Protect tower
[ ] Auto battler
[ ] Exploration
[ ] Items give benefits to specific slots (rather than units)
[ ] Display stats for each unit type, and boons in add menu
[ ] Display stats for each unit slot when hovering

# TODO
[x] Make rng seed and map seed separate so that map can be predictable at least...
[x] Others things we want predictable can be an addition to the seed and a hash as a shortcut...
[ ] Visual or textual representation of which unit is under current control
